<h2>Branch Structure Overview</h2>
Currently the main branch is just a blank slate.

<h3>Frontend Branch</h3>

The latest version of the Frontend branch is fully independent from the backend. It operates autonomously and connects directly to the database for testing purposes, with the possibility of future modifications or integrations.

This branch also contains the project documentation, including diagrams and other supporting materials used during the design and development of the application.

<h3>Backend Branch</h3>

The latest version of the Backend branch contains the complete project. It includes the backend services as well as a compiled production build of the frontend, which is served from the static resources directory.
