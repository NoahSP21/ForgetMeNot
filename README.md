<h2>Branch Structure Overview</h2>
<h3>Frontend Branch</h3>

The latest version of the Frontend branch is fully independent from the backend. It operates autonomously and connects directly to the database for testing purposes, with the possibility of future modifications or integrations.

This branch also contains the project documentation, including diagrams and other supporting materials used during the design and development of the application.
